Atsuki's Portfolio

Description
=====================
Welcome to my portfolio website, where I showcase my skills and work as a web developer. This site serves as an introduction to who I am and the projects I have worked on.

Purpose
=====================
This portfolio project was undertaken as part of a mid-term assignment during my studies. It was an excellent opportunity for me to apply my knowledge of React and Tailwind CSS and create a platform to present myself as a skilled engineer.

Features
=====================
This is a single-page application (SPA) built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for animations. The key features of this portfolio include:

Interactive and Dynamic Elements:
-------------------
I utilized React hooks, such as useState, to manage and update the state of components. An example of this is the navigation button in the top right corner, which responds dynamically to user interactions.

Enhanced User Experience:
-------------------
By employing useEffect, I was able to incorporate features that interact with components beyond React's state management. For instance, I implemented a loader that appears while the main content is being loaded using the setInterval function within useEffect.

Smooth Page Transitions: 
-------------------
With the help of React Router (version 6.13), I created multiple pages with unique URLs, making it easier to manage and navigate through different sections of the portfolio.

Engaging Animations:
-------------------
Framer Motion was utilized to add captivating animations to various components. Examples include the gradual appearance of the loader on the initial page, the gradual reveal of the title, and the slide-in effect of items.

Technologies Used
=====================
The technologies and tools employed in this portfolio project include:

React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useLocation): 
-------------------
Used to manage component state, interact with external data and events, and ensure smooth transitions between pages.

React Router (v6.13): 
-------------------
Utilized to create multiple pages with distinct URLs, facilitating easy navigation and management of the portfolio sections.

Framer Motion: 
-------------------
Implemented to create visually appealing and dynamic animations, enhancing the overall user experience.

By leveraging these technologies, I have developed a captivating and informative portfolio website that effectively presents my skills and projects as a web developer.
